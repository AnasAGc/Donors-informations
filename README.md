# Donors-informations


ou will be building a simple webpage "Donation Site".

As a user, I would like to add Donors to a table so I can track the Donors in my system.

Create a form in order to add the Donor name, Amount of Donation. The Donation should be one of a predefined list that contains the following: 100JD, 500JD, 1000JD
As a user, I would like to view the Donor's name

each Donor should have a name.
As a user, I would like to view the age for each Donor.

whenever we add a new Donor, you should generate the Donor age as an integer random number between 18 and 30.
As a user, I would like to view all of my Donor that I already added.

Whenever you add a Donor using the form, you should use the local storage in order to get all the Donor from it and render them as a table using DOM.
As a user, I would like to view the total money of all the Donors that I have in the table(Stretch goal)

whenever you add a new Donor , you should display the updated value of totals under the table
